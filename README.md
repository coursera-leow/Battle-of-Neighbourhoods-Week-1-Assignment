Introduction/Business Problem

A London based budget airline company is exploring the feasibility of adding Toronto as a new destination. The company has enjoyed tremendous success in the London – New York route. Its objective is to replicate this success adding a new destination similar to New York. The company has approached my consultancy company to do a feasibility study. 
The success of the London- New York route can be attributed broadly to two main factors; demand from leisure travelers and demand from business travelers

1)	Demand from leisure travelers
Art and Culture – World class museums, theatres, plays, concerts, festivals
Shopping
Food and cafes
Bars and restaurants

2)	Demand from business travelers
Global/regional financial centers are locations with concentration of Banks, Insurance companies, Asset management companies. There should also be multi-functional infrastructure offering some of the best legal, medical, and entertainment facilities.
In order to compare whether Toronto could satisfy the demands required by these two group of travelers, I could use the location data in Foursquare to study in details.
